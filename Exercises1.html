    <h1>Artificial Intelligence: Definition and Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to
      perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks
      include learning from experience, recognizing patterns, understanding
      language, and making decisions. AI systems are programmed to process large
      amounts of data, identify patterns within that data, and use those
      patterns to make informed predictions or decisions. From virtual
      assistants like Siri and Alexa to recommendation algorithms on Netflix and
      Spotify, AI has become an integral part of our daily lives, transforming
      how we work, communicate, and solve complex problems.

    <h2>Applications and Impact of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      AI technology is revolutionizing numerous industries and sectors around
      the world. In healthcare, AI assists doctors in diagnosing diseases and
      developing personalized treatment plans. In finance, AI algorithms detect
      fraudulent transactions and optimize investment strategies. The
      transportation industry is being transformed by self-driving vehicles,
      while AI-powered chatbots improve customer service in retail and
      telecommunications. Additionally, AI enhances scientific research by
      analyzing vast datasets and accelerating discoveries in fields like drug
      development and climate science. The impact of AI extends to education,
      agriculture, manufacturing, and entertainment, making it one of the most
      transformative technologies of our time.

    <h3>Challenges and Future of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <p>
      Despite its tremendous potential, AI development faces significant
      challenges that need to be addressed. Ethical concerns include bias in AI
      algorithms, privacy issues regarding data collection, and the potential
      displacement of workers due to automation. There are also questions about
      AI transparency and accountability, as some AI systems operate as "black
      boxes" that cannot easily explain their decision-making processes. Looking
      ahead, the future of AI depends on developing responsible AI practices,
      implementing strong regulations, and ensuring that AI benefits are shared
      equitably across society. As AI continues to evolve, striking a balance
      between innovation and ethical responsibility will be crucial for
      harnessing its full potential while minimizing risks.
